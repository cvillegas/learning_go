* Learning GO 

This is my plan to learn GO from zero, as Linux Sysadmin I have some experience in other
languages. I will share my trip providing all the online resources and the
scripts.

** First step: Download and install Go
Go to http://golang.org and download the last version 

In my case was the version 1.15 

''' 
sudo tar -C /usr/local/ -xzf go1.15.linux-amd64.tar.gz 
'''
